    <h1>Scrambled Eggs With Cheese: A Healthy Breakfast</h1>
    <img src="../assets/eggs.jpg" alt="some tasty eggs!" height="500" width="500">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs by themselves are already pretty good. They are high in protein and taste great
      but a great change you can make to them is adding shredded cheese. This makes the eggs have a "gooey"er 
      structure while also tasting even better. I have made these many many times and I would highly recommend!
